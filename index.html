            <p class="about-description">Hello, I'm Steven Chen</p>
            <p class="about-description">I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of California, 
                Davis. My coursework, professional experience, and projects have equipped me with skills in operating systems, 
                computer networks, artificial intelligence, and full-stack development. My practical experience includes 
                software development, troubleshooting, and collaboration within interdisciplinary teams. I'm passionate about leveraging 
                technology to solve complex problems and eager to continue growing and learning in the ever-evolving field of computer science.</p>

                    <p>My subteam are tasked with integrating and enhancing radar and camera systems for an autonomous vehicle. Our project leverages cutting-edge tools 
                        like YOLOv8 for object detection and DSpace Aurelion for realistic sensor simulation. We aim to refine the sensor fusion architecture, allowing 
                        for robust perception and tracking of various objects within the vehicle's environment. This project not only challenges us to apply complex algorithms 
                        and manage high-end software but also enables us to tackle real-world engineering problems in autonomous systems development.</p>

                    <p>As a team member of the Water-Level project, I've been involved in developing a machine learning model to predict the water levels of Lake Berryessa, 
                        especially critical given California's ongoing drought conditions. Our project utilizes a variety of data, including inflow, outflow, and precipitation 
                        rates, sourced from the California Department of Water Resources. We created predictive models using both polynomial regression and neural networks, attempting to 
                        provide reliable forecasts that could help in managing water resources more effectively.</p>

                    <p>In the ECS-189 Project, I developed the custom weapon systems using Unity, focusing on creating distinctive projectile and melee weapons with features like Pierce,
                         Chain, Explosive, and Boomerang effects. I tackled gameplay mechanics to prevent projectiles from repeatedly hitting the same enemy using a list-based tracking 
                         system. Additionally, I integrated an armor system and other feature for the player character, enhancing both the strategic depth and 
                         balance of gameplay. This project allowed me to refine our game's interactive and combat elements significantly.</p>
